# My website

This is the code for my website. Not sure why you are looking at this. It's really not that useful to anyone else...

Anyway, if you must know here is how you run the site:

1. Install jekyll and bower
2. Run `bower install`
3. Run `jekyll serve` to run the site locally or `jekyll serve --drafts` to run the site with drafts enabled.
4. Profit
