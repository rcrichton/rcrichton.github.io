Hey, my name is Ryan and I'm an software developer and open source advocate. I work for a not-for-profit organisation called [Jembi Health Systems NPC](http://www.jembi.org) and copntribute towards the [OpenHIE](http://ohie.org) effort.

I attened the University of Kwa-ZuluNatal in Durban, South Africa and obtained my honours degree in Computer Science in 2008. I have just recently completed my Masters by dissertation (March 2015).

In time I plan to capture some of my thoughts and write about interesting project that I am working on.

Cheers for now,
Ryan
