Hi, my name is Ryan and I'm an software developer and open source advocate. I work for a not-for-profit organisation called [Jembi Health Systems NPC](http://www.jembi.org) and contribute towards the [OpenHIE](http://ohie.org) effort.

I attened the University of Kwa-ZuluNatal in Durban, South Africa and obtained my honours degree in Computer Science in 2008. I have just recently completed my Masters by dissertation (March 2015).

Here I occasionally write about my experiences as a programmer/tech-enthusiast and/or interesting projects that I am working on.
